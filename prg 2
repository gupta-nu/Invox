Continuous Integration with Jenkins:
Tool: Jenkins, Tomcat
Program:
 Install and configure Jenkins.
 Create a simple pipeline to:
o Clone a Git repository.
o Build a sample project (e.g., a Java Maven or Python project).
Run test cases and archive the results.
 Install Jenkins and Tomcat on Windows(we have uploaded videos for
installation of Jenkins and Tomcat in GCR)
Step-1: Create maven project with .war format
Step-2: Create one html/jsp file in “src/main/webapp/index.html” and add
HTML code to it.
Step-3: Create “src/main/webapp/WEB-INF” folder. In that
“src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml” file.
Step-4: Include below plugin in “web.xml”
<plugin>
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
<configuration>
<webXml>src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\index.jsp</webXml> (mention which
page to start)
</configuration>
</plugin>
Step-5: Update project – Maven clean install compile test (make sure build
Successful)
Adding Project to git:
Open terminal/command prompt, navigate to project directory and run
“git init”
Step 1: Create a GitHub Account and create new repository

Step 2: Install Git on Your PC, Configure your name and email
Step 3: Initialize Git in Eclipse:
Open Eclipse and go to your Maven project in the Project Explorer.
Right-click the project → Team → Share Project.
Select Git, then click Next.
Click Create to create a new local Git repository.
Click Finish.
Step 4: Add & Commit Files
Right-click the project → Team → Add to Index (this stages all files for
commit).
Right-click again → Team → Commit.
Enter a commit message like "Initial commit" and click Commit.
Adding Project to git
Step 5: Connect to GitHub and Push
Copy your GitHub repository URL (from the GitHub page where you created the
repository).
In Eclipse:
Right-click the project → Team → Remote → Push.
Click Create Remote.
Enter origin as the remote name.
Paste the GitHub repository URL.
Click Next.
Select Branch to Push:
Source ref: master (or main, depending on GitHub).
Destination ref: master (or main).
Click Next, then Finish.

Enter your GitHub username and personal access token (create using GitHub ).
Step 6: Verify on GitHub
Go to your GitHub repository page and refresh. You should see your project files uploaded!
Note: Next time when you modify your project in eclipse follow step 4 and 5 with commit
message as “updated version”.

Jenkins Configuration
Step1: Make Sure you have Git and Maven installed
In Jenkins UI, Goto Manage Jenkins -> Global Tool Configuration Section of Jenkins->Add
maven configuration->give maven version name and select maven version from the
dropdown menu.
Step2: Install maven integration, Deploy to Container and git & GitHub Plugin.
Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Available -> Deploy to Container Plugin, maven
integration & git & GitHub Plugin.

Step3: Create and Configure a Maven Job with Source Code Management (Github)
New Item -> Select Free Style Project
 In the Configuration Section, Under Source Code Management Fill your Gitlab
Repository URL (Create public Repository in GitHub).
Step 4: Next, we need to move to the Build section and select Invoke top-level Maven
target options from the dropdown.
 Maven Version will be pre-populated from the Maven version we have defined in
the Global Tool Configuration.
 Under Goals, we have to provide the Maven command to trigger the
execution. Maven Clean and install
Step 5 : Configure the Post-build Action and Specify the Tomcat Server Details
Dept of CS&E, DSCE4
Drag to the bottom and Go to the Post-build Actions section
Click on Add post-build action button
On the available options click on the Deploy war/ear to container
Choose the Context Path in which the application should be installed. It would rename the
WAR file before deploying to the server and thereby the application context root would be
changed.
Tomcat URL http://[Tomcat Server Host]:[Primary http port]/( http://localhost:portnumber)
Build Jenkins Job
Execute the Job you have created by clicking on the Build Now button
Dept of CS&E, DSCE5
Console Output after the Successful build.
At the last line you can see that the WAR file has been generated and deployed on the remote
server.
Testing the Application
As the deployment is completed and the Jenkins Job ran Successfully without issues.
Let us test our application. Got to your web browser and type the URL should be as follows
